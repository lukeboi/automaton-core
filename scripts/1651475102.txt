A man has a book, a chair, a pencil and a box. Written in the style of an action-packed performance, what does he do?
 

The man sits down in the chair and opens the book. He finds his place with the pencil and starts reading. After a while, he gets up to stretch his legs, then goes back to the book. 
He takes a break and goes to the kitchen to make some tea.  he returns to his seat, sipping his tea as he continues reading.
He gets to the end of the chapter and closes the book, then puts it on the shelf.
He picks up the box and looks inside. 

The man put the box down and went to bed. 

The man wakes up and realizes it was all a dream.
